# PIEZOELECTRIC-COLLOCATED-PATCHES-ON-BEAM

Active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches

This project was created in the context of my diploma thesis for my "MSc Mechanical Engineer" degree. It utilizes advanced control techniques theory along with Finite Element Method (FEM) and an analytic model of a beam to predict its behavior. The primary focus is on implementing active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches.

## Features

- Utilizes advanced control techniques theory
- Implements Finite Element Method (FEM) and an analytic model of a beam
- Active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches
- Customization of LQR command in MATLAB for tweaking state and input cost matrices
