# PIEZOELECTIC-COLLOCATED-PATCHES-ON-BEAM

Active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches


That was created in the context of my diploma thesis for my "MSc Mechanical Engineer" degree.
I made use of advanced control techniques theory along with FEM and analytic model of a beam so as to predict its behaviour. I utilized the lqr command of matlab tweaking the state and input cost matrices, in order to create a structure that meets specific prerequisites.
