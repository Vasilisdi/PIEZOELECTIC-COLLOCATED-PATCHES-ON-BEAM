# PIEZOELECTRIC-COLLOCATED-PATCHES-ON-BEAM

Active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches

This project was created in the context of my diploma thesis for my "MSc Mechanical Engineer" degree. It utilizes advanced control techniques theory along with Finite Element Method (FEM) and an analytic model of a beam to predict its behavior. The primary focus is on implementing active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches.

## Features

- Utilizes advanced control techniques theory
- Implements Finite Element Method (FEM) and an analytic model of a beam
- Active vibration control using piezoelectric collocated patches
- Customization of LQR command in MATLAB for tweaking state and input cost matrices

## Concept

The goal of this very project is to develop an active vibration control system using beam and plate theory. In both cases, both the analytical and FEM model have been developed. Bear in mind that it has been chosen that a set of eight sensing patches and an additional set of eight actuating patches have been attached on the structure. 

Structure modelling: 
- Beam FEM theory
- Beam analytical theory
- Plate FEM theory
- Plate analytical theory

In addition the the previously mentioned modelling, state space modelling has been developed so as to make use of an LQR and an MPC controller. This has been combined with prediction estimator modelling, which requires the use of two different models. In place of the actual structure both the FEM and analytical models have been used, so as to substitute the identification modelling.
